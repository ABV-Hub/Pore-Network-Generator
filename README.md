### What is this repository for? ###

* This is the repo for the porenetwork generator build by Lucas van Oosterhout and Chaozhong Qin at the University of Utrecht.
* Version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* The generator is setup by running make in the networkgen directory
* Add the moment there are no configuration steps needed to build
* A valid C++11 compiler *is* needed. The software builds with gcc-4.6 and clang-3.5 and higher, use other compilers at your own risk.
* At the moment the clang compiler is used, if you want to change this to gcc change the CXX := clang++ to CXX:=g++ and you are set to go.
